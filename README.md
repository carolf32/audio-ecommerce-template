# Audio Ecommerce 
This is my first Full Stack solo project, I used my Users API (that you can check <a href="https://github.com/carolf32/users-API">here</a> to register new users and access products in this project. The second part of this project will make possible edit to the stock of this store, in admin's point of view. I used React JS on the Front End, Axios to conect with the server, Zod for validation and serialization, React Router Dom and Reack Hook Form for the routes and the forms, React Tostify for popups, React Icons and Tailwind Css for styling and finally Typescript for coding.
You can try the website as an User <a href="https://audio-ecommerce-template-m89p.vercel.app">here</a>

The second part of the project, the stock application for this e-commerce can be found <a href="https://github.com/carolf32/admin-stock-template/tree/main">here<a/>.
