# Audio Ecommerce 
This is my first Full Stack solo project, I used my USERS API (that you can check <a href="https://github.com/carolf32/users-API">here</a>. I used React JS on the Front End, Axios to conect with the server, Zod for validation and serialization, React Router Dom and Reack Hook Form for the routes and the forms, React Tostify for popups, React Icons and Tailwind Css for styling and finally Typescript for coding.
